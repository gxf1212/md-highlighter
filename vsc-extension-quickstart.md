# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
* `syntaxes/.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Make sure the language configuration settings in `language-configuration.json` are accurate.
* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Add more language features

* To add features such as IntelliSense, hovers and validators check out the VS Code extenders documentation at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.


## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.


Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

No

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
